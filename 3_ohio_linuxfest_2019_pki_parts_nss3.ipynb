    "> Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support cross-platform development of communications applications that support SSL, S/MIME, and other Internet security standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those interested in the history of NSS, it can be found here (https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/history)[]\n",
    "\n",
    "While NSS and OpenSSL can both accomplish the same task, they both provide some interesting ways to accomplish them. In some cases a distribution may leverage more of one method then the other, but as we will see in the later sections, this is all being unified into a common set of libraries. In some cases NSS may not be loaded with the base installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one primary difference between the two projects is that NSS uses a database for storing the certificates. Along with providing an API method to access certificate function. It is common to find it being used by many application in the Linux ecosystem, some directly, others via the system. "
