    "In our example we will be looking at the Yubikey with Personal Identity Verification (PIV) mechanisms to see how we can set up a device that will allow for use of certificate authenitcation to a local system. We will be looking at the PIV method, since we are exploring the PKI components, I state this because Yubikey provides other methods. \n",

    "_Yubikey provides a PAM module and other configuration tools that abstract out what we will be doing in this section. For our purposes, to see the sausage made, we will be using the basic `opensc` tools and working directly with them. While this will be a bit more difficult, it will allow us to swap out the yubikey with any vendor supplied PIV style mechanism._\n",
